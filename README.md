# Introduction
This is the implementation of [Extending Monocular Visual Odometry to Stereo Camera Systems by Scale Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12723). Here, we adapted [DSO](https://github.com/JakobEngel/dso) as our underlying monocular visual odometry.

# VirtualBox Trial
Here is the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mmDkwb7FmldyFLzeeZsRPSgBfSqbZ_mD/view?usp=sharing) to a VirtualBox file. Where the project is installed and tested for the readers who would like to try the project without installation.

# Dependencies
[DSO](https://github.com/JakobEngel/dso)

# Installation
```
install [DSO](https://github.com/JakobEngel/dso)
change DSO_PATH in CMakeLists.txt: set(DSO_PATH PATH_TO_DSO)

cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/jiawei-mo/scale_optimization.git
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
```

# Usage
- Calibrate stereo cameras, using the format of examples in **cams**. Refer to [DSO](https://github.com/JakobEngel/dso) for more details of intrinsic parameters.

- Create a launch file by the format of **launch/sample.launch**.

```
roslaunch so_dso [YOUR_LAUNCH_FILE]
```

- Ctrl-C to terminate and the output files will be written to **.ros** folder.

# Output files
- **poses.txt**: poses of all frame, using the TUM RGB-D / TUM monoVO format ([timestamp x y z qx qy qz qw] of the cameraToWorld transformation).

Time logs:
- **fps_time.txt**: runtime of each frame.
- **scale_time.txt**: runtime of scale optimization.
- **ba_time.txt**: runtime of bundle adjustment.

# Parameters
The only extra parameter of this work over [DSO](https://github.com/JakobEngel/dso) is the **scale_accept_th**, which is the threshold to accept a result from scaler optimizer. Usually, it is around 10-15.

# Code Explaination
- The core of scale optimization is implemented in **src/ScaleOptimizer**; **src/ScaleAccumulator** handles SSE operations in scale optimization. 
- We augmented [FullSystem](https://github.com/JakobEngel/dso/tree/master/src/FullSystem) of DSO to **src/SODSOSystem** with scale optimization. 
- The files in **src/dso_helpers** are helpers for DSO which are directly copied from DSO. 
- The main() locates in **src/so_dso_node.cpp**.

# Tests on EuRoC dataset
In the start of EuRoC dataset,the drone is flying up down and looking at very close objects (e.g. the wood platform). These cases are too challenging for the initialization of scale optimization (i.e. find an initial scale in a brute-force way). The system achieves better performance if the start part is skipped.
